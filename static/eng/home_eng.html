                    We allowed the Holocaust to happen each time we didn’t find a way to stop it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We allowed the Holocaust to happen each time we decided there was something more important to fix, first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We allowed the Holocaust to happen each time we said: it is someone’s else call.

                <p>
                        During the third weekend of 2019 170 people died in the Mediterranean Sea trying to reach Europe.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Who reach Italy  suffers continued repression due to the fact of not being Italian.

                <p>
                        This reality can’t be accepted anymore.

                        We can not remain astonished but we must remain <span>HUMAN</span> and <span>RESPECTFUL</span>.

                <p>
                        For this reason I call a relay fast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>GOAL</span>: obtain from Europe and European governments that immigration is considered with the aim to find inclusive and positive solutions and not just in term of costs and enemies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>METHODS</span>: this is a relay fast to be able to have 170 people on fast for 170 days. If we will be 171 we will try to be 340.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>LIMITATIONS</span>: we are social. We have lives, families, passions and jobs. A participant can fast for maximum 5 days during 4 weeks. It is possible to do intermittent fast in blocks of 24 hours.
                    Only 21+ yaers old can partecipate. Any participant accept the complete and total responsability of his own choices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>FAST</span>: 20 people fasting for one day are better than 4 fasting for one. Fasting means abstinence from food.
                    Please keep drinking water and RESPECT your life.
                    Tea, coffee and herbal teas are allowed.
                    For any doubt contact your family doctor.
                    It is possible to participate with other forms of abstinence: smoke and alcohol for example.

                    <span><u>DISCLAIMER</u></span>: 
                    Fasting is the practice of voluntary deprivation of food. It is a practice to be undertaken only if you are sure of your physical condition. Participation in the project is allowed only for adults. By accepting to participate you are aware of the choice made and will not consider any one else responsible for possible physical consequences.
                    It is imperative to maintain proper hydration during the hunger strike.
